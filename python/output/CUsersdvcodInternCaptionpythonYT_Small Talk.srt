00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,000
me.
[Confidence: 98.40%]

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,100
Hi.
[Confidence: 76.70%]
3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,879
I'm trying to relax.
[Confidence: 93.77%]
4
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,719
Would you mind?
[Confidence: 84.70%]
5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,520
Oh, sorry, mister.
[Confidence: 81.67%]
6
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,320
Hey, kid. Kid, kid.
[Confidence: 88.42%]
7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,100
Just come over here and sit down, would you?
[Confidence: 96.37%]
8
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,060
Okay.
[Confidence: 71.20%]
9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,100
What's your name, mister? My name is Adam.
[Confidence: 98.90%]
10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,480
You look like my grandpa except he's not as old.
[Confidence: 94.08%]
11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,899
That's very...
[Confidence: 95.15%]
12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,340
That's very rude.
[Confidence: 98.00%]
13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm Adam.
[Confidence: 99.90%]
14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,740
Who are you?
[Confidence: 100.00%]
15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,120
Joseph.
[Confidence: 96.70%]
16
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,379
Where's your mother?
[Confidence: 99.90%]
17
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,379
She's with her boyfriend.
[Confidence: 99.92%]
18
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,039
I'm supposed to wait over here.
[Confidence: 97.42%]
19
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm eight and three quarters, mister.
[Confidence: 94.28%]
20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,579
How old are you?
[Confidence: 100.00%]
21
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,739
Mister, you're boring.
[Confidence: 99.37%]
22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,640
Hey, listen, kid.
[Confidence: 94.83%]
23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Hey listen I'd like some peace and quiet. Please?
[Confidence: 85.47%]
24
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,659
You're grumpy mister. Is that why that woman left you on the bench? Was she your girlfriend?
[Confidence: 92.51%]
25
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,280
No. No wasn't. Listen
[Confidence: 87.78%]
26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,039
I have a girlfriend mister. And I'm only in the second grade. Where's your girlfriend?
[Confidence: 92.19%]
27
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,599
My wife, Elizabeth.
[Confidence: 96.77%]
28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,719
gone.
[Confidence: 98.40%]
29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,200
Well, where has she gone to?
[Confidence: 96.55%]
30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,719
She's gone.
[Confidence: 100.00%]
31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,739
Gone.
[Confidence: 99.70%]
32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,259
Dead.
[Confidence: 99.20%]
33
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:10,900
Oh.
[Confidence: 100.00%]
34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,079
That's sad.
[Confidence: 100.00%]
35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,759
Well, my girlfriend Katie,
[Confidence: 91.83%]
36
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,240
she's still really young.
[Confidence: 99.98%]
37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,379
Was she a good girlfriend?
[Confidence: 99.26%]
38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,539
Katie's the best I've had.
[Confidence: 97.88%]
39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,240
Yes. Elizabeth was one of a kind.
[Confidence: 90.53%]
40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,020
Why? Have you ever had any other girlfriends?
[Confidence: 96.75%]
41
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,120
Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower she gave me a kiss on the cheek.
[Confidence: 96.80%]
42
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,319
Have you ever brought a girl a flower?
[Confidence: 95.67%]
43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,819
Kid, you've got a lot to learn about relationships.
[Confidence: 95.49%]
44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,979
Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and had a whole...
[Confidence: 96.20%]
45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,219
a whole conversation in an instant.
[Confidence: 98.93%]
46
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,039
Laughed with someone.
[Confidence: 99.53%]
47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,340
Kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing.
[Confidence: 97.67%]
48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,050
Have you ever cried when...
[Confidence: 95.30%]
49
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,680
I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie.
[Confidence: 99.27%]
50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,659
But that was because I had scraped my knee badly.
[Confidence: 97.69%]
51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,539
Yes?
[Confidence: 57.90%]
52
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,860
Are you going to get a new girlfriend?
[Confidence: 97.12%]
53
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,900
going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?
[Confidence: 94.95%]
54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,120
Nah.
[Confidence: 54.20%]
55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,719
I'm happy just by myself.
[Confidence: 96.96%]
56
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,900
I think you're grumpy.
[Confidence: 99.25%]
57
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,979
I have lots of girlfriends, mister.
[Confidence: 96.05%]
58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,360
Over six.
[Confidence: 95.60%]
59
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,599
Lizzie was my one and only.
[Confidence: 95.03%]
60
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,060
Ugh.
[Confidence: 62.60%]
61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,479
You talk about your girlfriend a lot.
[Confidence: 99.06%]
62
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:51,680
My wife.
[Confidence: 86.60%]
63
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,560
I love getting girlfriends, mister. You should try it.
[Confidence: 93.63%]
64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,240
there's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.
[Confidence: 92.68%]
65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,039
Plus, I thought I was a boring, grumpy old guy.
[Confidence: 95.98%]
66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,579
Nah, you're nice.
[Confidence: 89.00%]
67
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,360
Well, once you stop reading.
[Confidence: 88.78%]
68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,680
See that pretty girl over there?
[Confidence: 99.52%]
69
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,639
I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds.
[Confidence: 92.17%]
70
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,879
There's always time.
[Confidence: 95.43%]
71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,899
Gotta go, mister. Bye.
[Confidence: 87.75%]
72
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
Nice day, isn't it?
[Confidence: 97.88%]
73
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:42,839
Yeah.
[Confidence: 96.90%]
74
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:53,800
It's beautiful.
[Confidence: 88.05%]
75
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,000
I really enjoy the park.
[Confidence: 91.42%]
